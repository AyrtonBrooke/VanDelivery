# VanDelivery
Van Delivery algorithm using python 

This code focuses on sorting the deliveries based off distance from one another starting from HQ. The van will use this as a route and end at the HQ once all deliveries have been made. It also sorts the deliveries based off the route.

# Improvements
Generate sample data for ease of testing algorithm
Implement time slots for customers, breaks for drivers
Use google maps API to calculate the time more effeciently considering traffic and road closures and max speed of the road
Van considerations (max speed, max weight)
Delivery considerations (min drop offs)
